# NFCsecure
NFCsecure allows you to remind you that your NFC is enabled. You only need to press a button to activate the service in the application ! You can customize the desired delay before receiving the notification.

#### General information
The idea of creating NFCsecure came when I noticed that Google Pay does not ask me to revalidate my identity when paying (with a code or a fingerprint). Thus, once my phone is unlocked and my NFC activated, any malicious person could abuse a moment of inattention to debit my card.
