# NFCsecure
NFCsecure allows you to remind you that your NFC is enabled. You only need to press a button to activate the service in the application ! You can customize the desired delay before receiving the notification.

#### General information
The idea of creating NFCsecure came when I noticed that Google Pay does not ask me to revalidate my identity when paying (with a code or a fingerprint). Thus, once my phone is unlocked and my NFC activated, any malicious person could abuse a moment of inattention to debit my card.

#### Advertising
Advertisements partially fund the infrastructure (servers, APIs, etc.) used for my IT projects. Ads have been placed in the projects in such a way that they do not disrupt the user experience.

The application uses AdMob from Google in order to display advertising. AdMob and its partners may use cookies and certain personal data for analysis, statistics, and to offer the advertisements most likely to interest the user. However, in application of the GDPR, the user can at any time decide how his personal data is used. The user may oppose the use of his personal data. This choice will not disable advertisements but will make them less relevant to the user.

#### Installation
Not available for now (but soon on Play Store).
